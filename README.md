# What2Wear

Have you ever brought too many or not enough layers outside? Do you live in a place that has lots of wildfires and ash and you worry you'll bring a regular mask when you should have brought a N95? Then this app is for you! It checks the weather and tells you what you should wear so you don't have to! If you ever brought too few clothes one day, let the app know and it will change its suggestions! Your layering preferences are stored in the cloud so you can get suggestions wherever you are!
